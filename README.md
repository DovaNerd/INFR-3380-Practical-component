Explanation: The two buttons in the design are for the additional effects one button will be used to allow the player a short dash, whilst the other will allow the player to fire a projectile in the direction they are moving. The two potentiometers are to simualte a joystick that is present in the orginal Pac-man which is used to control the direction he can move one potentiometer is for left/right movement whilst the other is for up/down movement
