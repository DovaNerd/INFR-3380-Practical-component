Explanation (TinkerCAD): The two buttons in the design are for the additional effects one button will be used to allow the player a short dash, whilst the other will allow the player to fire a projectile in the direction they are moving. The two potentiometers are to simualte a joystick that is present in the orginal Pac-man which is used to control the direction he can move one potentiometer is for left/right movement whilst the other is for up/down movement

Explanation (Controller): For the design of my controller I decided to go for the ghost as the overall look, the controller features a joystick for directional movement, as well as two button one for dashing(left) and the other for firing a projectile(right). the joystick will function with and accelerometer, and the buttons are simply two buttons. The arduino is featured in the back of the housing where a hole has been cut to allow for the wire to pass through. In addition a support has been added for the arduino to rest on. The entire housing will be combined via glue or reheating the plastic to bond and the arduino will be fixed to its support via glue as well.
