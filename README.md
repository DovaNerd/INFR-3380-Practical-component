Explanation (TinkerCAD): The two buttons in the design are for the additional effects one button will be used to allow the player a short dash, whilst the other will allow the player to fire a projectile in the direction they are moving. The two potentiometers are to simualte a joystick that is present in the orginal Pac-man which is used to control the direction he can move one potentiometer is for left/right movement whilst the other is for up/down movement

Explanation (Controller): For the design of my controller I decided to go for the ghost as the overall look, the controller features a joystick for directional movement, as well as two button one for dashing(left) and the other for firing a projectile(right). the joystick will function with and accelerometer, and the buttons are simply two buttons. The arduino is featured in the back of the housing where a hole has been cut to allow for the wire to pass through.
